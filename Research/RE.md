## Projects
### Behneshan; A video game to teach sign language to deaf children using AI asnd Machine Vision       	         
University of Isfahan, BME department, Isfahan, Iran				          
This project uses LSTM neural networks to create a software that teaches Persian Sign Language (PSL) to deaf children via a platformer game, Computer Vision techniques, and pose landmark recognition. The system accurately recognizes 29 PSL letters and practical words with a 96% accuracy rate.
